# Google Clone
 ðŸŽ²This project is a clone of Googleâ€™s homepage, created with HTML and CSS to practice web layout and accessible design. I aimed to replicate Googleâ€™s minimalist interface, paying close attention to element structure, centering, and alignment using Flexbox and positioning techniques. A particular focus was placed on accessible design for interactive elements, like buttons, ensuring they meet accessibility standards by implementing clear labels, sufficient contrast, and a responsive layout. This project helped me refine my understanding of user-friendly, accessible interfaces and improve my layout and styling skills.ðŸŽ²
